        <item>In traditional Spider-Man canon, Gwen Stacy is Peter Parker\'s girlfriend. However, she
            tragically died when taken captive by the Green Goblin. Her death made comics history as
            the first time a hero was failed to rescue his girl.\n\nBut in alternate universe Earth-65,
            Gwen Stacy transforms from tragic victim to hero.
            That\'s right, in this world, Gwen Stacy received spider powers in lieu of Peter Parker.
            Then, in a flipped fate, Gwen is unable to save Peter after his transformation into the
            Lizard.</item>
        <item>Deadpool\'s name comes from his time at Hospice (the alleged government facility where
            failed superhuman operatives were treated. During this time, Deadpool and a host of others
            were experimented on by Doctor Killbrew and Ajax. Due to the sadistic and tortuous nature
            of the experiments, patients placed bets in a \"deadpool\" on who they expected to expire
            first. Following his escape, Wade Wilson then took on the name Deadpool, becoming the
            merc with a mouth who we all know and love.</item>
        <item>Iron Man was created by Stan Lee as a challenge to create a hero that no one should
            like and force people to like him. From the mouth of Stan himself:\n\n\"I think I gave myself
            a dare. It was the height of the Cold War. The readers, the young readers, if there was
            one thing they hated, it was war, it was the military....So I got a hero who represented
            that to the hundredth degree. He was a weapons manufacturer, he was providing weapons for
            the Army, he was rich, he was an industrialist....I thought it would be fun to take the
            kind of character that nobody would like, none of our readers would like, and shove him
            down their throats and make them like him....And he became very popular.\"</item>
