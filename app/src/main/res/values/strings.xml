        <item>In traditional Spider-Man canon, Gwen Stacy is Peter Parker\'s girlfriend. However, she
            tragically died when taken captive by the Green Goblin. Her death made comics history as
            the first time a hero was failed to rescue his girl.\n\nBut in alternate universe Earth-65,
            Gwen Stacy transforms from tragic victim to hero.
            That\'s right, in this world, Gwen Stacy received spider powers in lieu of Peter Parker.
            Then, in a flipped fate, Gwen is unable to save Peter after his transformation into the
            Lizard.</item>
        <item>Deadpool\'s name comes from his time at Hospice (the alleged government facility where
            failed superhuman operatives were treated. During this time, Deadpool and a host of others
            were experimented on by Doctor Killbrew and Ajax. Due to the sadistic and tortuous nature
            of the experiments, patients placed bets in a \"deadpool\" on who they expected to expire
            first. Following his escape, Wade Wilson then took on the name Deadpool, becoming the
            merc with a mouth who we all know and love.</item>
